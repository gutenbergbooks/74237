  <h2 class='c008'>HEDDA GABLER. <br> <br> INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Munich, on June 29, 1890, Ibsen wrote to the
Swedish poet, Count Carl Snoilsky: “Our intention
has all along been to spend the summer in the Tyrol
again. But circumstances are against our doing so.
I am at present engaged upon a new dramatic work,
which for several reasons has made very slow progress,
and I do not leave Munich until I can take with me
the completed first draft. There is little or no prospect
of my being able to complete it in July.” Ibsen
did not leave Munich at all that season. On October
30 he wrote: “At present I am utterly engrossed in
a new play. Not one leisure hour have I had for
several months.” Three weeks later (November 20)
he wrote to his French translator, Count Prozor:
“My new play is finished; the manuscript went off to
Copenhagen the day before yesterday.... It produces
a curious feeling of emptiness to be thus suddenly
separated from a work which has occupied one’s
time and thoughts for several months, to the exclusion
of all else. But it is a good thing, too, to have done
with it. The constant intercourse with the fictitious
personages was beginning to make me quite nervous.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>To the same correspondent he wrote on December 4:
”The title of the play is <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>. My intention
in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda, as a
personality, is to be regarded rather as her father’s
daughter than as her husband’s wife.  It was not my
desire to deal in this play with so-called problems.
What I principally wanted to do was to depict
human beings, human emotions, and human destinies,
upon a groundwork of certain of the social conditions
and principles of the present day.“</p>

<p class='c001'>So far we read the history of the play in the official
“Correspondence.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Some interesting glimpses into
the poet’s moods during the period between the completion
of <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> and the publication
of <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> are to be found in the series of letters
to Fräulein Emilie Bardach, of Vienna, published by
Dr. George Brandes.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> This young lady Ibsen met at
Gossensass in the Tyrol in the autumn of 1889. The
record of their brief friendship belongs to the history
of <cite>The Master Builder</cite> rather than to that of <cite>Hedda
Gabler</cite>, but the allusions to his work in his letters to her
during the winter of 1889 demand some examination.</p>

<p class='c001'>So early as October 7, 1889, he writes to her: ”A
new poem begins to dawn in me. I will execute it this
winter, and try to transfer to it the bright atmosphere
of the summer. But I feel that it will end in sadness—such
is my nature.“ Was this “dawning” poem
<cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>? Or was it rather <cite>The Master Builder</cite>
that was germinating in his mind? Who shall say?
The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, for
it is hard to believe that, at any stage in the incubation
of <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, he can have conceived it as even
beginning in a key of gaiety. A week later, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>he appears to have made up his mind that the time
had not come for the poetic utilisation of his recent
experiences. He writes on October 15: ”Here I sit
as usual at my writing-table. Now I would fain
work, but am unable to. My fancy, indeed, is very
active. But it always wanders away. It wanders
where it has no business to wander during working
hours. I cannot repress my summer memories—nor
do I wish to. I live through my experiences again
and again and yet again. To transmute it all into a
poem, I find, in the meantime, impossible.“ Clearly,
then, he felt that his imagination ought to have been
engaged on some theme having no relation to his
summer experiences—the theme, no doubt, of <cite>Hedda
Gabler</cite>. In his next letter, dated October 29, he
writes: “Do not be troubled because I cannot, in the
meantime, create (<i>dichten</i>). In reality I am for ever
creating, or, at any rate, dreaming of something which,
when in the fulness of time it ripens, will reveal itself
as a creation (<span lang="de"><i>Dichtung</i></span>).” On November 19 he says:
“I am very busily occupied with preparations for
my new poem. I sit almost the whole day at my
writing-table. Go out only in the evening for a little
while.” The five following letters contain no allusion
to the play; but on September 18, 1890, he wrote:
“My wife and son are at present at Riva, on the Lake
of Garda, and will probably remain there until the
middle of October, or even longer. Thus I am quite
alone here, and cannot get away. The new play on
which I am at present engaged will probably not be
ready until November, though I sit at my writing-table
daily, and almost the whole day long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here ends the history of <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, so far as the
poet’s letters carry us. Its hard clear outlines, and
perhaps somewhat bleak atmosphere, seem to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>resulted from a sort of reaction against the sentimental
“dreamery” begotten of his Gossensass experiences.
He sought refuge in the chill materialism of Hedda
from the ardent transcendentalism of Hilda, whom he
already heard knocking at the door. He was not yet
in the mood to deal with her on the plane of poetry.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> was published in Copenhagen on
December 16, 1890. This was the first of Ibsen’s
plays to be translated from proof-sheets and published
in England and America almost simultaneously
with its first appearance in Scandinavia. The
earliest theatrical performance took place at the
Residenz Theater, Munich, on the last day of January
1891, in the presence of the poet, Frau Conrad-Ramlo
playing the title-part. The Lessing Theater, Berlin,
followed suit on February 10. Not till February 25
was the play seen in Copenhagen, with Fru Hennings
as Hedda. On the following night it was given for
the first time in Christiania, the Norwegian Hedda
being Fröken Constance Bruun. It was this production
which the poet saw when he visited the
Christiania Theater for the first time after his return
to Norway, August 28, 1891. It would take pages
to give even the baldest list of the productions and
revivals of <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> in Scandinavia and Germany,
where it has always ranked among Ibsen’s most
popular works. The admirable production of the play
by Miss Elizabeth Robins and Miss Marion Lea, at
the Vaudeville Theatre, London, April 20, 1891, may be
counted the second great step towards the popularisation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>of Ibsen in England, the first being the Charrington-Achurch
production of <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> in 1889.
Miss Robins afterwards repeated her fine performance
of Hedda many times, in London, in the English
provinces, and in New York. The character has also
been acted in London by Eleonora Duse, and as I
write (March 5, 1907) by Mrs. Patrick Campbell, at the
Court Theatre. In America, Hedda has frequently
been acted by Mrs. Fiske, Miss Nance O’Neill and
other actresses—quite recently by a Russian actress,
Madame Alla Nazimova, who (playing in English)
has made a great success both in this part and
in Nora. The first French Hedda Gabler was Mlle.
Marthe Brandès, who played the part at the Vaudeville
Theatre, Paris, on December 17, 1891, the performance
being introduced by a lecture by M. Jules
Lemaître. In Holland, in Italy, in Russia, the play has
been acted times without number. In short (as might
easily have been foretold) it has rivalled <cite>A Doll’s
House</cite> in world-wide popularity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been suggested,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> I think without sufficient
ground, that Ibsen deliberately conceived <cite>Hedda
Gabler</cite> as an “international” play, and that the scene
is really the “west end” of any great European city.
To me it seems quite clear that Ibsen had Christiania
in mind, and the Christiania of a somewhat earlier
period than the ’nineties. The electric cars, telephones,
and other conspicuous factors in the life of a modern
capital are notably absent from the play. There is no
electric light in Secretary Falk’s villa. It is still the
habit for ladies to return on foot from evening parties,
with gallant swains escorting them. This “suburbanism,”
which so distressed the London critics of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>1891, was characteristic of the Christiania Ibsen
himself had known in the ’sixties—the Christiania of
<cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>—rather than of the greatly extended
and modernised city of the end of the century. Moreover,
Lövborg’s allusions to the fiord, and the suggested
picture of Sheriff Elvsted, his family and his avocations,
are all distinctively Norwegian. The truth seems to
be very simple—the environment and the subsidiary
personages are all thoroughly national, but Hedda
herself is an “international” type, a product of civilisation
by no means peculiar to Norway.</p>

<p class='c001'>We cannot point to any individual model or models
who “sat to” Ibsen for the character of Hedda.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The
late Grant Allen declared that Hedda was “nothing
more nor less than the girl we take down to dinner in
London nineteen times out of twenty”; in which case
Ibsen must have suffered from a superfluity of models,
rather than from any difficulty in finding one. But
the fact is that in this, as in all other instances, the
word “model” must be taken in a very different sense
from that in which it is commonly used in painting.
Ibsen undoubtedly used models for this trait and that,
but never for a whole figure. If his characters can be
called portraits at all, they are composite portraits.
Even when it seems pretty clear that the initial
impulse towards the creation of a particular character
came from some individual, the original figure is
entirely transmuted in the process of harmonisation
with the dramatic scheme.  We need not, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>look for a definite prototype of Hedda; but
Dr. Brandes shows that two of that lady’s exploits
were probably suggested by the anecdotic history of
the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ibsen had no doubt heard how the wife of a well-known
Norwegian composer, in a fit of raging jealousy
excited by her husband’s prolonged absence from
home, burnt the manuscript of a symphony which he
had just finished. The circumstances under which
Hedda burns Lövborg’s manuscript are, of course,
entirely different and infinitely more dramatic; but
here we have merely another instance of the dramatisation
or “poetisation” of the raw material of life.
Again, a still more painful incident probably came to
his knowledge about the same time. A beautiful and
very intellectual woman was married to a well-known
man who had been addicted to drink, but had entirely
conquered the vice. One day a mad whim seized her
to put his self-mastery and her power over him to the
test. As it happened to be his birthday, she rolled
into his study a small keg of brandy, and then withdrew.
She returned some time afterwards to find
that he had broached the keg, and lay insensible on
the floor. In this anecdote we cannot but recognise
the germ, not only of Hedda’s temptation of Lövborg,
but of a large part of her character.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus,” says Dr. Brandes, “out of small and scattered
traits of reality Ibsen fashioned his close-knit
and profoundly thought-out works of art.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For the character of Eilert Lövborg, again, Ibsen
seems unquestionably to have borrowed several traits
from a definite original. A young Danish man of
letters, whom Dr. Brandes calls Holm, was an
enthusiastic admirer of Ibsen, and came to be
on very friendly terms with him. One day Ibsen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>was astonished to receive, in Munich, a parcel
addressed from Berlin by this young man, containing,
without a word of explanation, a packet of his (Ibsen’s)
letters, and a photograph which he had presented to
Holm. Ibsen brooded and brooded over the incident,
and at last came to the conclusion that the young man
had intended to return her letters and photograph to
a young lady to whom he was known to be attached,
and had in a fit of aberration mixed up the two objects
of his worship. Some time after, Holm appeared at
Ibsen’s rooms. He talked quite rationally, but professed
to have no knowledge whatever of the letter-incident,
though he admitted the truth of Ibsen’s
conjecture that the <span lang="fr">“belle dame sans merci”</span> had demanded
the return of her letters and portrait. Ibsen
was determined to get at the root of the mystery; and
a little inquiry into his young friend’s habits revealed
the fact that he broke his fast on a bottle of port wine,
consumed a bottle of Rhine wine at lunch, of Burgundy
at dinner, and finished off the evening with one
or two more bottles of port. Then he heard, too, how,
in the course of a night’s carouse, Holm had lost the
manuscript of a book; and in these traits he saw the
outline of the figure of Eilert Lövborg.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some time elapsed, and again Ibsen received a
postal packet from Holm. This one contained his
will, in which Ibsen figured as his residuary legatee.
But many other legatees were mentioned in the instrument—all
of them ladies, such as Fräulein Alma
Rothbart, of Bremen, and Fräulein Elise Kraushaar,
of Berlin. The bequests to these meritorious spinsters
were so generous that their sum considerably
exceeded the amount of the testator’s property. Ibsen
gently but firmly declined the proffered inheritance;
but Holm’s will no doubt suggested to him the figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of that red-haired “Mademoiselle Diana” who is
heard of but not seen in <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, and enabled
him to add some further traits to the portraiture of
Lövborg. When the play appeared, Holm recognised
himself with glee in the character of the bibulous man
of letters, and thereafter adopted “Eilert Lövborg”
as his pseudonym. I do not, therefore, see why Dr.
Brandes should suppress his real name; but I willingly
imitate him in erring on the side of discretion. The
poor fellow died several years ago.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some critics have been greatly troubled as to the
precise meaning of Hedda’s fantastic vision of Lövborg
“with vine-leaves in his hair.” Surely this is a
very obvious image or symbol of the beautiful, tho
ideal, aspect of bacchic elation and revelry. Antique
art, or I am much mistaken, shows us many figures of
Dionysus himself and his followers with vine-leaves
entwined in their hair. To Ibsen’s mind, at any rate,
the image had long been familiar. In <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>
(Act iv. sc. 8), when Peer, having carried off Anitra,
finds himself in a particularly festive mood, he cries:
“Were there vine-leaves around, I would garland my
brow.” Again, in <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite> (Pt. II. Act i.)
where Julian, in the procession of Dionysus, impersonates
the god himself, it is directed that he shall
wear a wreath of vine-leaves. Professor Dietrichson
relates that among the young artists whose society
Ibsen frequented during his first years in Rome, it was
customary, at their little festivals, for the revellers to
deck themselves in this fashion. But the image is so
obvious that there is no need to trace it to any personal
experience. The attempt to place Hedda’s vine-leaves
among Ibsen’s obscurities is an example of the
firm resolution not to understand which animated the
criticism of the ’nineties.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Dr. Brandes has dealt very severely with the
character of Eilert Lövborg, alleging that we cannot
believe in the genius attributed to him. But where
is he described as a genius? The poet represents him
as a very able student of sociology; but that is a quite
different thing from attributing to him such genius as
must necessarily shine forth in every word he utters.
Dr. Brandes, indeed, declines to believe even in his
ability as a sociologist, on the ground that it is idle to
write about the social development of the future.
“To our prosaic minds,” he says, “it may seem as if
the most sensible utterance on the subject is that of
the fool of the play: ‘The future! Good heavens,
we know nothing of the future.’” The best retort to
this criticism is that which Eilert himself makes:
”There’s a thing or two to be said about it all the
same.“ The intelligent forecasting of the future (as
Mr. H. G. Wells has shown) is not only clearly distinguishable
from fantastic Utopianism, but is indispensable
to any large statesmanship or enlightened
social activity. With very real and very great respect
for Dr. Brandes, I cannot think that he has been
fortunate in his treatment of Lövborg’s character. It
has been represented as an absurdity that he should
think of reading extracts from his new book to a man
like Tesman, whom he despises. But though Tesman
is a ninny, he is, as Hedda says, a ”specialist“—he is
a competent, plodding student of his subject. Lövborg
may quite naturally wish to see how his new method, or
his excursion into a new field, strikes the average
scholar of the Tesman type. He is, in fact, ”trying it
on the dog“—neither an unreasonable nor an unusual
proceeding. There is, no doubt, a certain improbability
in the way in which Lövborg is represented as
carrying his manuscript around, and especially in Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Elvsted’s production of his rough draft from her
pocket; but these are mechanical trifles, on which
only a niggling criticism would dream of laying stress.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all Ibsen’s works, <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> is the most
detached, the most objective—a character-study pure
and simple. It is impossible—or so it seems to me—to
extract any sort of general idea from it. One cannot
even call it a satire, unless one is prepared to
apply that term to the record of a “case” in a work
on criminology. Reverting to Dumas’s dictum that a
play should contain “a painting, a judgment, an
ideal,” we may say that <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> fulfils only the
first of these requirements. The poet does not even
pass judgment on his heroine: he simply paints her
full-length portrait with scientific impassivity. But
what a portrait! How searching in insight, how
brilliant in colouring, how rich in detail! Grant Allen’s
remark, above quoted, was, of course, a
whimsical exaggeration: the Hedda type is not so
common as all that, else the world would quickly come
to an end. But particular traits and tendencies of
the Hedda type are very common in modern life, and
not only among women. Hyperæsthesia lies at the
root of her tragedy. With a keenly critical, relentlessly
solvent intelligence, she combines a morbid
shrinking from all the gross and prosaic detail of the
sensual life. She has nothing to take her out of herself—not
a single intellectual interest or moral enthusiasm.
She cherishes, in a languid way, a petty
social ambition; and even that she finds obstructed
and baffled. At the same time she learns that another
woman has had the courage to love and venture all,
where she, in her cowardice, only hankered and refrained.
Her malign egoism rises up uncontrolled,
and calls to its aid her quick and subtle intellect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>She ruins the other woman’s happiness, but in doing
so incurs a danger from which her sense of personal
dignity revolts. Life has no such charm for her that
she cares to purchase it at the cost of squalid humiliation
and self-contempt. The good and the bad in her
alike impel her to have done with it all; and a pistol-shot
ends what is surely one of the most poignant
character-tragedies in literature. Ibsen’s brain never
worked at higher pressure than in the conception and
adjustment of those “crowded hours” in which Hedda,
tangled in the web of Will and Circumstance, struggles
on till she is too weary to struggle any more.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may not be superfluous to note that the “a” in
“Gabler” should be sounded long and full, like the
“a” in “garden”—<i>not</i> like the “a” in “gable” or in
“gabble.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE MASTER BUILDER. <br> <br> INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>With <cite>The Master Builder</cite>—or <cite>Master Builder Solness</cite>,
as the title runs in the original—we enter upon the
final stage in Ibsen’s career. “You are essentially
right,” the poet wrote to Count Prozor in March 1900,
“when you say that the series which closes with the
Epilogue (<cite>When We Dead Awaken</cite>) began with <cite>Master
Builder Solness</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ibsen,” says Dr. Brahm, ”wrote in Christiania all
the four works which he thus seems to bracket together—<i>Solness</i>,
<i>Eyolf</i>, <i>Borkman</i>, and <cite>When We Dead
Awaken</cite>. He returned to Norway in July 1891, for
a stay of indefinite length; but the restless wanderer
over Europe was destined to leave his home no more....
He had not returned, however, to throw himself,
as of old, into the battle of the passing day. Polemics
are entirely absent from the poetry of his old age.
He leaves the State and Society at peace. He who
had departed as the creator of Falk [in <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>]
now, on his return, gazes, not satirically, but rather in
a lyric mood, into the secret places of human nature
and the wonders of his own soul.“</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Brahm, however, seems to be mistaken in thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>that Ibsen returned to Norway with no definite
intention of settling down. Dr. Julius Elias (an
excellent authority) reports that shortly before Ibsen
left Munich in 1891, he remarked one day, “I must
get back to the North!” “Is that a sudden impulse?”
asked Elias. “Oh no,” was the reply; ”I
want to be a good head of a household and have my
affairs in order. To that end I must consolidate my
property, lay it down in good securities, and get it
under control—and that one can best do where one has
rights of citizenship.“ Some critics will no doubt be
shocked to find the poet whom they have written down
an “anarchist” confessing such bourgeois motives.</p>

<p class='c001'>After his return to Norway, Ibsen’s correspondence
became very scant, and we have no letters dating from
the period when he was at work on <cite>The Master Builder</cite>.
On the other hand, we possess a curious lyrical prelude
to the play, which he put on paper on March 16, 1892.
It is said to have been his habit, before setting to
work on a play, to “crystallise in a poem the mood
which then possessed him”; but the following is the
only one of these keynote-poems which has been published.
I give it in the original language, with a

  </div>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>They sat there, the two, in so cosy a house, through autumn
and winter days. Then the house burned down. Everything
lies in ruins. The two must grope among the ashes.</p>

<p class='c001'>For among them is hidden a jewel—a jewel that never can
burn. And if they search faithfully, it may easily happen that
he or she may find it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even should they find it, the burnt-out two—find this
precious unburnable jewel—never will she find her burnt faith,
he never his burnt happiness.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This is the latest piece of Ibsen’s verse that has
been given to the world; but one of his earliest poems—first
printed in 1858—was also, in some sort, a
prelude to <cite>The Master Builder</cite>. Of this a literal translation
may suffice. It is called</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>BUILDING-PLANS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I remember as clearly as if it had been to-day the evening
when, in the paper, I saw my first poem in print. There I sat
in my den, and, with long-drawn puffs, I smoked and I dreamed
in blissful self-complacency.</p>

<p class='c001'>”I will build a cloud-castle. It shall shine all over the
North. It shall have two wings: one little and one great.
The great wing shall shelter a deathless poet; the little wing
shall serve as a young girl’s bower.“</p>

<p class='c001'>The plan seemed to me nobly harmonious; but as time went
on it fell into confusion. When the master grew reasonable,
the castle turned utterly crazy; the great wing became too
little, the little wing fell to ruin.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Thus we see that, thirty-five years before the date of
<cite>The Master Builder</cite>, Ibsen’s imagination was preoccupied
with a symbol of a master building a castle
in the air, and a young girl in one of its towers.</p>

<p class='c001'>There has been some competition among the poet’s
young lady friends for the honour of having served
as his model for Hilda. Several, no doubt, are entitled
to some share in it. One is not surprised to
learn that among the papers he left behind were
sheaves upon sheaves of letters from women. “All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>these ladies,” says Dr. Julius Elias, ”demanded something
of him—some cure for their agonies of soul, or
for the incomprehension from which they suffered;
some solution of the riddle of their nature. Almost
every one of them regarded herself as a problem to
which Ibsen could not but have the time and the
interest to apply himself. They all thought they had
a claim on the creator of Nora.... Of this chapter
of his experience, Fru Ibsen spoke with ironic humour.
‘Ibsen (I have often said to him), Ibsen, keep these
swarms of over-strained womenfolk at arm’s length.’
‘Oh no (he would reply), let them alone. I want to
observe them more closely.’ His observations would
take a longer or shorter time as the case might be, and
would always contribute to some work of art.“</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal model for Hilda was doubtless
Fräulein Emilie Bardach, of Vienna, whom he met at
Gossensass in the autumn of 1889. He was then
sixty-one years of age; she is said to have been seventeen.
As the lady herself handed his letters to Dr.
Brandes for publication, there can be no indiscretion
in speaking of them freely. Some passages from them
I have quoted in the introduction to <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>—passages
which show that at first the poet deliberately
put aside his Gossensass impressions for use when he
should stand at a greater distance from them, and
meanwhile devoted himself to work in a totally
different key. On October 15, 1889, he writes, in his
second letter to Fräulein Bardach: “I cannot repress
my summer memories, nor do I want to. I live
through my experiences again and again, and yet again.
To transmute it all into a poem I find, in the meantime,
impossible. In the meantime? Shall I succeed
in doing so sometime in the future? And do I really
wish to succeed? In the meantime, at any rate, I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>not.... And yet it must come in time.” The letters
number twelve in all, and are couched in a tone of
sentimental regret for the brief, bright summer days
of their acquaintanceship. The keynote is struck in
the inscription on the back of a photograph which he
gave her before they parted: <span lang="fr"><i>An die Maisonne eines
Septemberlebens—in Tirol</i></span>, 27/9/89.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> In her album he
had written the words:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>in which we may, if we like, see a foreshadowing of
the Solness frame of mind. In the fifth letter of the
series he refers to her as “an enigmatic Princess”; in
the sixth he twice calls her “my dear Princess”; but
this is the only point at which the letters quite
definitely and unmistakably point forward to <cite>The
Master Builder</cite>. In the ninth letter (February 6, 1890)
he says: “I feel it a matter of conscience to end, or,
at any rate, to restrict, our correspondence.” The
tenth letter, six months later, is one of kindly condolence
on the death of the young lady’s father. In
the eleventh (very short) note, dated December 30,
1890, he acknowledges some small gift, but says:
“Please, for the present, do not write to me again....
I will soon send you my new play [<cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>].
Receive it in friendship, but in silence!” This injunction
she apparently obeyed. When <cite>The Master Builder</cite>
appeared, it would seem that Ibsen did not even send
her a copy of the play; and we gather that he was
rather annoyed when she sent him a photograph signed
“Princess of Orangia.” On his seventieth birthday,
however, she telegraphed her congratulations, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>which he returned a very cordial reply. And here
their relations ended.</p>

<p class='c001'>That she was right, however, in regarding herself as
his principal model for Hilda, appears from an anecdote
related by Dr. Elias.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> It is not an altogether pleasing
anecdote, but Dr. Elias is an unexceptionable witness,
and it can by no means be omitted from an examination
into the origins of <cite>The Master Builder</cite>. Ibsen had come
to Berlin in February 1891 for the first performance of
<cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>. Such experiences were always a trial
to him, and he felt greatly relieved when they were
over. Packing, too, he detested; and Elias having
helped him through this terrible ordeal, the two sat
down to lunch together, while awaiting the train. An
expansive mood descended upon Ibsen, and chuckling
over his champagne-glass, he said: ”Do you know, my
next play is already hovering before me—of course in
vague outline. But of one thing I have got firm hold.
An experience: a woman’s figure. Very interesting,
very interesting indeed. Again spice of devilry in
it.“ Then he related how he had met in the Tyrol a
Viennese girl of very remarkable character. She had
at once made him her confidant. The gist of her confessions
was that she did not care a bit about one day
marrying a well brought-up young man—most likely
she would never marry. What tempted and charmed
and delighted her was to lure other women’s husbands
away from them. She was a little dæmonic wrecker;
she often appeared to him like a little bird of prey,
that would fain have made him, too, her booty. He
had studied her very, very closely. For the rest, she
had had no great success with him. ”She did not get
hold of me, but I got hold of her—for my play. Then
I fancy“ (here he chuckled again) “she consoled herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>with some one else.” Love seemed to mean for
her only a sort of morbid imagination. This, however,
was only one side of her nature. His little model had
had a great deal of heart and of womanly understanding;
and thanks to the spontaneous power she could
gain over him, every woman might, if she wished it,
guide some man towards the good. “Thus Ibsen
spoke,” says Elias, ”calmly and coolly, gazing as it were
into the far distance, like an artist taking an objective
view of some experience—like Rubek speaking of his
soul-thefts. He had stolen a soul, and put it to a
double employment. Thea Elvsted and Hilda Wangel
are intimately related—are, indeed, only different
expressions of the same nature.“ If Ibsen actually
declared Thea and Hilda to be drawn from one model,
we must of course take his word for it; but the
relationship is hard to discern.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no reasonable doubt, then, that the
Gossensass episode gave the primary impulse to <cite>The
Master Builder</cite>. But it seems pretty well established,
too, that another lady, whom he met in Christiania
after his return in 1891, also contributed largely to the
character of Hilda. This may have been the reason
why he resented Fraülein Bardach’s appropriating to
herself the title of “Princess of Orangia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The play was published in the middle of December
1892. It was acted both in Germany and England
before it was seen in the Scandinavian capitals. Its
first performance took place at the Lessing Theatre,
Berlin, January 19, 1893, with Emanuel Reicher as
Solness and Frl. Reisenhofer as Hilda. In London
it was first performed at the Trafalgar Square Theatre
(now the Duke of York’s) on February 20, 1893, under
the direction of Mr. Herbert Waring and Miss Elizabeth
Robins, who played Solness and Hilda. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>one of the most brilliant and successful of English
Ibsen productions. Miss Robins was almost an ideal
Hilda, and Mr. Waring’s Solness was exceedingly able.
Some thirty performances were given in all, and the
play was reproduced at the Opera Comique later in
the season, with Mr. Lewis Waller as Solness. In the
following year Miss Robins acted Hilda in Manchester.
In Christiania and Copenhagen the play was produced
on the same evening, March 8, 1893; the Copenhagen
Solness and Hilda were Emil Poulsen and Fru Hennings.
A Swedish production, by Lindberg, soon
followed, both in Stockholm and Gothenburg. In
Paris <span lang="fr"><cite>Solness le constructeur</cite></span> was not seen until April 3,
1894, when it was produced by  “L’Œuvre” with
M. Lugné-Poë as Solness. This company, sometimes
with Mme. Suzanne Desprès and sometimes with
Mme. Berthe Bady as Hilda, in 1894 and 1895 presented
the play in London, Brussels, Amsterdam,
Milan, and other cities. In October 1894 they visited
Christiania, where Ibsen was present at one of their
performances, and is reported by Herman Bang to
have been so enraptured with it that he exclaimed,
“This is the resurrection of my play!” On this
occasion Mme. Bady was the Hilda. The first performance
of the play in America took place at the
Carnegie Lyceum, New York, on January 16, 1900,
with Mr. William H. Pascoe as Solness and Miss
Florence Kahn as Hilda. The performance was
repeated in the course of the same month, both at
Washington and Boston.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England, and probably elsewhere as well, <cite>The
Master Builder</cite> produced a curious double effect. It
alienated many of the poet’s staunchest admirers, and
it powerfully attracted many people who had hitherto
been hostile to him. Looking back, it is easy to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>why this should have been so; for here was certainly
a new thing in drama, which could not but set up many
novel reactions. A greater contrast could scarcely be
imagined than that between the hard, cold, precise
outlines of <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> and the vague mysterious
atmosphere of <cite>The Master Builder</cite>, in which, though
the dialogue is sternly restrained within the limits of
prose, the art of drama seems for ever on the point of
floating away to blend with the art of music. Substantially,
the play is one long dialogue between Solness
and Hilda; and it would be quite possible to analyse
this dialogue in terms of music, noting (for example)
the announcement first of this theme and then of
that, the resumption and reinforcement of a theme
which seemed to have been dropped, the contrapuntal
interweaving of two or more motives, a scherzo here,
a fugal passage there. Leaving this exercise to someone
more skilled in music (or less unskilled) than
myself, I may note that in <cite>The Master Builder</cite> Ibsen
resumes his favourite retrospective method, from
which in <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> he had in great measure
departed. But the retrospect with which we are here
concerned is purely psychological. The external events
involved in it are few and simple in comparison with
the external events which are successively unveiled in
the retrospective passages of <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> or <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>.
The matter of the play is the soul-history of
Halvard Solness, recounted to an impassioned listener—so
impassioned, indeed, that the soul-changes it
begets in her form an absorbing and thrilling drama.
The graduations, retardations, accelerations of Solness’s
self-revealment are managed with the subtlest art, so
as to keep the interest of the spectator ever on the
stretch. The technical method was not new; it was
simply that which Ibsen had been perfecting from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span><cite>Pillars of Society</cite> onward; but it was applied to a
subject of a nature not only new to him, but new to
literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the play is full of symbolism it would be
futile to deny; and the symbolism is mainly autobiographic.
The churches which Solness sets out by
building doubtless represent Ibsen’s early romantic
plays, the “homes for human beings,” his social dramas;
while the houses with high towers, merging into
“castles in the air,” stand for those spiritual dramas,
with a wide outlook over the metaphysical environment
of humanity, on which he was henceforth to be
engaged. Perhaps it is not altogether fanciful to
read a personal reference into Solness’s refusal to
call himself an architect, on the ground that his training
has not been systematic—that he is a self-taught
man. Ibsen too was in all essentials self-taught; his
philosophy was entirely unsystematic; and, like
Solness, he was no student of books. There may
be an introspective note also in that dread of the
younger generation to which Solness confesses. It is
certain that the old Master Builder was not lavish of
his certificates of competence to young aspirants,
though there is nothing to show that his reticence
ever depressed or quenched any rising genius.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, then, it cannot be doubted that several
symbolic motives are inwoven into the iridescent fabric
of the play. But it is a great mistake to regard it as
essentially and inseparably a piece of symbolism. Essentially
it is the history of a sickly conscience, worked
out in terms of pure psychology. Or rather, it is a
study of a sickly and a robust conscience side by side.
“The conscience is very conservative,” Ibsen has
somewhere said; and here Solness’s conservatism is
contrasted with Hilda’s radicalism—or rather would-be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>radicalism, for we are led to suspect, towards the
close, that the radical too is a conservative in spite
of herself. The fact that Solness cannot climb as
high as he builds implies, I take it, that he cannot act
as freely as he thinks, or as Hilda would goad him
into thinking. At such an altitude his conscience
would turn dizzy, and life would become impossible
to him. But here I am straying back to the interpretation
of symbols. My present purpose is to insist
that there is nothing in the play which has no meaning
on the natural-psychological plane, and absolutely
requires a symbolic interpretation to make it comprehensible.
The symbols are harmonic undertones;
the psychological melody is clear and consistent
without any reference to them.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> It is true that,
in order to accept the action on what we may call
the realistic level, we must suppose Solness to
possess and to exercise, sometimes in spite of himself,
and sometimes unconsciously, a considerable
measure of hypnotic power. But the time is surely
past when we could reckon hypnotism among “supernatural”
phenomena. Whether the particular forms
of hypnotic influence attributed to Solness do actually
exist is a question we need not determine. The poet
does not demand our absolute credence, as though
he were giving evidence in the witness-box. What
he requires is our imaginative acceptance of certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>incidents which he purposely leaves hovering on the
border between the natural and the preternatural, the
explained and the unexplained. In this play, as in
<cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite> and <cite>Little Eyolf</cite>, he shows a
delicacy of art in his dalliance with the occult which
irresistibly recalls the exquisite genius of Nathaniel
Hawthorne.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The critics who insist on finding nothing but symbolism
in the play have fastened on Mrs. Solness’s
“nine lovely dolls,” and provided the most amazing
interpretations for them. A letter contributed in
1893 to the <cite>Westminster Gazette</cite> records an incident
which throws a curious light on the subject, and may
be worth preserving. “At a recent first-night,” I
wrote, ”I happened to be seated just behind a well-known
critic. He turned round to me and said, ‘I
want you to tell me what is <em>your</em> theory of those “nine
lovely dolls.” Of course one can see that they are
entirely symbolical.’ ‘I am not so sure of that,’ I
replied, remembering a Norwegian cousin of my own
who treasured a favourite doll until she was nearer
thirty than twenty. ‘They of course symbolise the
unsatisfied passion of motherhood in Mrs. Solness’s
heart, but I have very little doubt that Ibsen makes
use of this “symbol” because he has observed a similar
case, or cases, in real life.’ ‘What!’ cried the critic.
‘He has seen a grown-up, a middle-aged, woman continuing
to “live with” her dolls!’ I was about to
say that it did not seem to me so very improbable,
when a lady who was seated next me, a total stranger
to both of us, leant forward and said, ‘Excuse my interrupting
you, but it may perhaps interest you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>know that <em>I have three dolls to which I am deeply
attached!</em>’ I will not be so rude as to conjecture this
lady’s age, but we may be sure that a very young
woman would not have had the courage to make such
an avowal. Does it not seem that Ibsen knows a thing
or two about human nature—English as well as Norwegian—which
we dramatic critics, though bound by
our calling to be subtle psychologists, have not yet
fathomed?“ In the course of the correspondence
which followed, one very apposite anecdote was
quoted from an American paper, the <cite>Argonaut</cite>: “An
old Virginia lady said to a friend, on finding a treasured
old cup cracked by a careless maid, ‘I know of nothing
to compare with the affliction of losing a handsome
piece of old china.’ ‘Surely,’ said the friend, ‘it is not
so bad as losing one’s children.’ ‘Yes, it is,’ replied
the old lady, ’for when your children die, you do have
the consolations of religion, you know.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be a paradox to call <cite>The Master Builder</cite>
Ibsen’s greatest work, but one of his three or four
greatest it assuredly is. Of all his writings, it is probably
the most original, the most individual, the most
unlike any other drama by any other writer. The
form of <i>Brand</i> and <i>Peer Gynt</i> was doubtless suggested
by other dramatic poems—notably by <i>Faust</i>. In <cite>The
Wild Duck</cite>, in <i>Rosmersholm</i>, in <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, even in
<cite>Little Eyolf</cite> and <cite>John Gabriel Borkman</cite>, there remain
faint traces of the French leaven which was so strong
in the earlier plays. But <cite>The Master Builder</cite> had no
model and has no parallel. It shows no slightest
vestige of outside influence. It is Ibsen, and nothing
but Ibsen.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>ACT FIRST.</h3>

<p class='c018'><i>A spacious, handsome, and tastefully furnished drawing-room,
decorated in dark colours. In the back,
a wide doorway with curtains drawn back, leading
into a smaller room decorated in the same style as
the drawing-room. In the right-hand wall of the
front room, a folding door leading out to the hall.
In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door,
also with curtains drawn back. Through the
panes can be seen part of a veranda outside, and
trees covered with autumn foliage. An oval table,
with a cover on it, and surrounded by chairs,
stands well forward. In front, by the wall on
the right, a wide stove of dark porcelain, a high-backed
arm-chair, a cushioned foot-rest, and two
footstools. A settee, with a small round table in
front of it, fills the upper right-hand corner. In
front, on the left, a little way from the wall, a
sofa. Further back than the glass door, a piano.
On either side of the doorway at the back a what-not
with terra-cotta and majolica ornaments.—Against
the back wall of the inner room a sofa, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>a table, and one or two chairs. Over the sofa
hangs the portrait of a handsome elderly man in
a General’s uniform. Over the table a hanging
lamp, with an opal glass shade.—A number of
bouquets are arranged about the drawing-room, in
vases and glasses. Others lie upon the tables.
The floors in both rooms are covered with thick
carpets.—Morning light. The sun shines in
through the glass door.</i></p>

<p class='c019'><i><span class='sc'>Miss Juliana Tesman</span>, with her bonnet on and carrying
a parasol, comes in from the hall, followed
by <span class='sc'>Berta</span>, who carries a bouquet wrapped in
paper. <span class='sc'>Miss Tesman</span> is a comely and pleasant-looking
lady of about sixty-five. She is nicely
but simply dressed in a grey walking-costume.
<span class='sc'>Berta</span> is a middle-aged woman of plain and
rather countrified appearance.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>No, I don’t know of anything except what I have

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Laughing to herself.</i>] Yes, of course I do. You
are quite right there. [<i>Changing the subject.</i>] But we
were talking about your journey. It must have
cost a great deal of money, George?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Tesman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you see—my handsome travelling-scholarship

    <div><span class='sc'>Miss Tesman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Miss Tesman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And especially travelling with a lady—they tell
me that makes it ever so much more expensive.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Tesman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, of course—it makes it a little more expensive.
But Hedda <em class='gesperrt'>had</em> to have this trip, Auntie!

<p class='c001'>Yes, there is an odour of mortality about it. It

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Vine-leaves? No, I saw nothing of the sort.

of the woman who had inspired him in his work—that
was the phrase he used.</p>

of us at any rate—all together; and Brack came
with us to get a breath of fresh air. And then,
you see, we agreed to take Eilert home; for he
had had far more than was good for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>But now comes the strange part of it, Hedda;

<p class='c001'>Lövborg, as well as the others, had been invited

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To make a long story short—he landed at last

    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A sort of a—singer?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes—in her leisure moments. And moreover
a mighty huntress—of men—Mrs. Hedda.
You have no doubt heard of her. Eilert Lövborg
was one of her most enthusiastic protectors—in
the days of his glory.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Far from amicably, it appears. After a most
tender meeting, they seem to have come to
blows——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Lövborg and she?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. He accused her or her friends of having
robbed him. He declared that his pocket-book
had disappeared—and other things as well. In
short, he seems to have made a furious disturbance.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It came to a general scrimmage, in which the
ladies as well as the gentlemen took part. Fortunately
the police at last appeared on the scene.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. I fancy it will prove a costly frolic for
Eilert Lövborg, crazy being that he is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He seems to have made a violent resistance—to
have hit one of the constables on the head and

him off to the police-station with the rest.</p>

  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Changing her tone.</i>] But tell me now, Judge—what

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, it could not be entirely

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course. However, I should scarcely have
troubled so much about that. But I thought
that, as a friend of the family, it was my duty to
supply you and Tesman with a full account of his
nocturnal exploits.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedda.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Why so, Judge Brack?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, because I have a shrewd suspicion that
he intends to use you as a sort of blind.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Good heavens, Mrs. Hedda—we have eyes in
our head. Mark my words! This Mrs. Elvsted

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Brack.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a single <em class='gesperrt'>home</em>. Henceforth, as before,

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. I confess it would be more than painful
to me if this personage were to be made free of

<p class='c001'>You see, they really are clever fellows, these
two. Each of them has talent in his own way.
But then the son took it into his head to get engaged;
and the next thing, of course, was that
he wanted to get married—and begin to build on
his own account. That is the way with all these
young people.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just so. But of course that did not suit <em class='gesperrt'>my</em>
plans; for I needed Ragnar myself—and the old
man too. He is exceedingly good at calculating
bearing-strains and cubic contents—and all that
sort of devilry, you know.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Solness.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I’ll tell you how that came about. One
day this girl, Kaia Fosli, came to see them on
some errand or other. She had never been here
before. And when I saw how utterly infatuated
they were with each other, the thought occurred
to me: if I could only get her into the office
here, then perhaps Ragnar too would stay where
he is.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Solness.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but at the time I did not breathe a word
of what was in my mind. I merely stood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>looked at her—and kept on wishing intently that
I could have her here. Then I talked to her a
little, in a friendly way—about one thing and
another. And then she went away.</p>

<p class='c001'>Aline and I lived there in the first years of our

it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, nothing of the kind. From the outside it
looked like a great, dark, ugly wooden box; but
all the same, it was snug and comfortable enough
inside.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hilda.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Solness.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The fright had shaken Aline terribly. The
alarm—the escape—the break-neck hurry—and
then the ice-cold night air—for they had to be
carried out just as they lay—both she and the

<p class='c001'>Oh no, <em class='gesperrt'>they</em> stood it well enough. But Aline
fell into a fever, and it affected her milk. She
would insist on nursing them herself; because it

<p class='c001'>No, <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> they did not get over. <em class='gesperrt'>That</em> was how

<p class='c001'>Hard enough for me; but ten times harder for

<p class='c001'>I didn’t like it. I know how free and happy I

<p class='c001'>I have not been systematically enough taught

<p class='c001'>Yes, thanks to the fire. I laid out almost the

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With subdued emphasis.</i>] It was simply and solely
by that fire that I was enabled to build homes for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>human beings. Cosy, comfortable, bright homes,
where father and mother and the whole troop of
children can live in safety and gladness, feeling
what a happy thing it is to be alive in the world—and
most of all to belong to each other—in great
things and in small.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Solness.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. That I might build homes for others, I
had to forego—to forego for all time—the home

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For you see, Hilda—up there, amidst those new
surroundings, I used to go about musing and pondering
within myself. Then I saw plainly why
he had taken my little children from me. It was
that I should have nothing else to attach myself
to. No such thing as love and happiness, you
understand. I was to be only a master builder—nothing
else. And all my life long I was to go
on building for him. [<i>Laughs.</i>] But I can tell

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Then I did the <em class='gesperrt'>impossible</em>—I no less than

<p class='c001'>And when I stood there, high over everything,

to him: Hear me now, thou Mighty One! From
this day forward I will be a free builder—I too, in

<p class='c001'>Yes, for now I see it. Men have no use for these
homes of theirs—to be happy in. And I should
not have had any use for such a home, if I had had
one. [<i>With a quiet, bitter laugh.</i>] See, that is the

</div>

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation can be
expressive. Several instances of dubious ‘?’ marks have
been corrected, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>A line at <a id='c_45.22'></a><a href='#corr45.22'>45.22</a> ends with no punctuation, which could plausibly
be either an exclamation or a question mark. A stage direction at <a id='c_93.10'></a><a href='#corr93.10'>93.10</a>
ends with an exclamation which perhaps should be a colon. A line at <a id='c_362.9'></a><a href='#corr362.9'>362.9</a> also
ends with no punction which could be a full stop or exclamation. A line
at <a id='c_172.18'></a><a href='#corr172.18'>172.18</a> lacks punctuation should be a full stop or exclamation.
At line <a id='c_362.13'></a><a href='#corr362.13'>362.13</a> punctuation could be also be a full top of exclamation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,
and noted the following for Volume X. Each of these was corrected
in printing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>
